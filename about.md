I am an experienced and naturally driven software developer. I'm always interested in new technologies and embrace investigate new paradigms of programming when I come across them. I've done commercial work in lower level languages like C++ and also higher level stuff using JavaScript, Perl, Python and various libraries and frameworks, such as React and React Native, Yii, Perl's Mason and everything in between.
